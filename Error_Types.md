Quantum noise and errors are fundamental challenges in quantum computing, affecting the accuracy and reliability of quantum circuits. In Qiskit, various noise models simulate these errors to study their impact and develop mitigation strategies. Here’s a brief overview of key quantum noise types:

1. **Depolarizing Error** – Represents random errors where a qubit state is replaced with a completely mixed state with a certain probability. Used in simulations to model general noise effects.

2. **Pauli Error** – Describes errors where a qubit undergoes unintended Pauli operations (X, Y, Z) with specific probabilities. Useful for studying discrete error channels.

3. **Thermal Relaxation Error** – Models energy dissipation due to interactions with the environment, characterized by relaxation times \(T_1\) (amplitude damping) and \(T_2\) (phase damping). Applied to simulate realistic qubit behavior.

4. **Amplitude Damping Error** – Represents loss of energy from an excited state to the ground state, commonly used to model decoherence in superconducting qubits.

5. **Phase Damping Error** – Captures loss of quantum phase information without energy dissipation, affecting coherence in quantum algorithms.

6. **Reset Error** – Simulates incorrect qubit initialization, where a qubit may reset to the wrong state. Used in error correction studies.

7. **Readout Error** – Occurs during measurement, where the classical output does not match the actual quantum state. Important for improving measurement fidelity.

8. **Coherent Unitary Error** – Represents systematic errors in gate operations due to imperfect control pulses. Used to analyze hardware imperfections.

9. **Mixed Unitary Error** – Models errors where a qubit undergoes a set of unitary transformations probabilistically. Useful for studying complex noise interactions.

These errors are incorporated into Qiskit’s **AerSimulator** to create realistic noise models for quantum circuit simulations. You can explore more details in [IBM Quantum’s documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/build-noise-models) on building noise models.



In a quantum network with two qubits, several types of noise and errors can affect the system's performance. These include:

1. **Depolarizing Noise** – Random errors where a qubit state is replaced with a mixed state, affecting fidelity in quantum communication.

2. **Amplitude Damping** – Represents energy loss from an excited state to the ground state, common in superconducting qubits.

3. **Phase Damping** – Causes loss of phase coherence without energy dissipation, impacting quantum entanglement.

4. **Readout Errors** – Occur during measurement, leading to incorrect classical outputs.

5. **Gate Errors** – Imperfections in quantum gate operations, including coherent unitary errors and systematic miscalibrations.

6. **Crosstalk Errors** – Unintended interactions between qubits, especially in closely coupled systems.

7. **Leakage Errors** – When a qubit transitions to an unintended higher energy state outside the computational basis.

These errors are critical in quantum networking, affecting entanglement fidelity and quantum teleportation protocols. You can explore more details in [this research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-024-04296-y) on quantum error mitigation strategies.



Your `build_noise_model()` function constructs a **realistic noise model** for quantum circuit simulation using Qiskit's `NoiseModel`. Here's a breakdown of the errors applied:

1. **Depolarizing Error** (`depol_error`):  
   - Probability: 0.05  
   - Applied to single-qubit gates (`u1`, `u2`, `u3`)  
   - Simulates random state corruption.

2. **Thermal Relaxation Error** (`thermal_error`):  
   - Relaxation times: \(T_1 = 0.1\), \(T_2 = 0.1\)  
   - Applied to gates (`h`, `x`, `z`)  
   - Models decoherence effects.

3. **Two-Qubit Depolarizing Error** (`depol_2qubit_error` - commented out):  
   - Probability: 0.05  
   - Intended for `cx` (CNOT gate)  
   - Would introduce correlated noise.

4. **Amplitude Damping Error** (`amplitude_damping`):  
   - Probability: 0.1  
   - Applied to gates (`x`, `z`)  
   - Represents energy loss to the environment.

Your model captures **decoherence, operational inaccuracies, and state perturbations**, making it suitable for realistic quantum system simulations. If you're analyzing quantum teleportation or networking, you might also consider **crosstalk errors** for multi-qubit interactions.
